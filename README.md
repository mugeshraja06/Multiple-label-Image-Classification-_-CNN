# Multiple-label-Image-Classification-_-CNN

 Build the Multiple label Image classification model using CNN to predict the movie genre by using their poster

Objective: We have chosen a movie poster data from the year 1980 to 2015. Our ultimate goal is to build the model by using CNN to suggest the genre of the movie from the movie posters for an online platform like Wikipedia and Netflix. 

Outcome: We were able to build the Multiple label Image classification model using CNN to predict the movie genre by using their poster. So that we can produce efficient and precise genre suggestion movies.
